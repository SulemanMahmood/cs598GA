\section{Future Directions}
This project show the feasibility of some approximations in real time systems. The data shows that approximate versions of the programs can give developers more options to chose from. For reasonably accurate, the system designers can chose energy efficiency or faster system according to their preferences.

An interesting idea in this domain is the about making real time operating system aware of the fact that they are working with approximate systems so that they can use approximate systems appropriately. Operating systems that are aware of the fact that they are dealing with approximate system may tell the consumer processes that they are using result of an approximate process. Additionally operating systems can expose functionality for programs to query their remaining time budget. Based on the time budget available, approximate programs can automatically set the knobs to obtain the most accurate result within the available time limit. This concept is similar to frameworks like Green \cite{Green} which adjust the knobs according to the accuracy requirements.
