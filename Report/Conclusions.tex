\section{Conclusions}
In this project we have modeled IOT systems as DTMC. We have incorporated unreliable messaging between different components of the modeled system. This allows us to analyses the effects of unreliable communication of IOT systems. Our experiments show that IOT systems can degrade quickly when channel reliability drops. This problem is worse when correct operation of the system requires a long chain of messages to reach their destination. But we also saw that a small number of retries can help restore the performance of the system. Analysis of the result from a larger model inspired by real world system shows that real world systems have redundancy built into the systems which can allow these systems to function properly even when networks are not very reliable. Another important effect is the time required for the system to resolve inconsistencies. We showed that the time required for the system to resolve inconsistencies increases as the message success probability drops. But if timing is not a critical part of the system then the small additional delay should be tolerable.
