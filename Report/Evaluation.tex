\section{Evaluation}
We have evaluated our models to answer three questions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{RQ1:} How sharply does the probability of system satisfying a property, falls in the face of unreliable communication?
  \item \textbf{RQ2:} How do retries help in restoring the probability of system satisfying a property?
  \item \textbf{RQ3:} How does time bound effect the probability of system satisfying a property?
\end{itemize}

To evaluate these questions, we constructed models of two IOT systems. We present the details of the test subjects below before describing our results.
